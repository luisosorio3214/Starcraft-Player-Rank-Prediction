# Starcraft-Player-Rank-Prediction

## Goal: 
We are given a dataset of Starcraft player performance data in ranked games. We want to develop a model to predict a player’s rank using the information provided in the dataset.

Attempt to solve the following problem on the provided dataset using Python (no restrictions on package usage):
● You’re given a dataset of Starcraft player performance data in ranked games. We want to develop a model to predict a player’s rank using the information provided in the dataset.
● Document your decision making throughout the model building process (EDA, ETL, modeling, evaluation, etc).
 - Try to functionize any repetitive tasks so that the workflow is simplified.
● Once you’ve settled on your model, communicate your findings to non-technical stakeholders.
● Hypothetical: after seeing your work, your stakeholders come to you and say that they can collect more data, but want your guidance before starting. How would you advise them based on your EDA and model results?
